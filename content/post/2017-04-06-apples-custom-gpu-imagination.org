#+title: Apple's custom GPU, Imagination
#+date: 2017-04-06

Apparently Imagination lost 60% of its stock value after it was revealed
that Apple wouldn't be shipping its PowerVR GPUs within two years.

60%. Do you know what that means? It means many people were surprised.
But why? If people had kept their heads to the ground they'd have
noticed long ago.

Apple was always about vertical integration. The custom CPUs were
already a big sign. And back in October 2016, the incredible David
Kanter already published an article about

custom GPU for the iPhone]].

You know what this also means?

Someone had shorted their Imagination stock.
