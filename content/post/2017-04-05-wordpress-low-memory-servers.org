#+title: Wordpress on Low Memory Servers
#+date: 2017-04-05

This site runs on a 512MB DigitalOcean droplet.Â  Every week or two the
Linux kernel would kill MySQL for using too much RAM... and restarting
it got tiring.

When I first start nginx, php-fpm and MySQL, the memory usage starts at
370MB and only goes upwards from there. htop (and journalctl) tells me
that MySQL is the biggest offender, so let's start there.

** MySQL
After some googling one parameter always popped up in every guide:
innodb_buffer_pool_size.
[[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size][MySQL
docs]] state that it's 128MB by default. So I reduced it to 8MB to see
what would happen. After all, I doubt the entirety of my posts on this
site+Wordpress settings could ever reach 8MB, and even if it did, it's
backed by an SSD, so who cares.

It made a huge difference. MySQL went from using 18% of my RAM (~92MB)
to just 8% (43MB).

** PHP
Some Googling led to
[[https://ma.ttias.be/a-better-way-to-run-php-fpm/][A better way to run
PHP]], which advocates using pm = ondemand instead of pm = dynamic.

Before, php-fpm had 3 child processes taking up 18% of my RAM. Now, it
has none, and it just spins them up on demand which makes a lot of
sense.

I don't use php-fpm pools so I ignored that part.

** 390MB memory on fresh start -> 140MB!!
The system now uses ~140MB of RAM and I'm pretty proud of myself - after
just two tweaks! Nobody cares about this site right now but if traffic
picks up I'll just enable nginx microcaching.
